# Matrix-multiplication-using-multithreading
Implement matrix multiplication using multithreading. Application should have pthread_create, pthread_join, pthread_exit. In the program, every thread must return the value and must be collected in pthread_join in the main function. Final sum of row-column multiplication must be done by main thread (main function).
